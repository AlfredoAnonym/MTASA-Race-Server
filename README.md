# MTASA-Race-Server
MTA:SA Race Server scripts, that will be fetched from this respository to my server

The stuff from here, will be fetched to my server: mtasa://51.75.58.35:10899 - and mainly those will be things for my "Map Uploader" resource, where you can upload maps (if you are logged in of course) straight from my server, inputting either a meta.xml + .map contents, or filling up the neccessary info about the map without meta.xml (it will get created automatically for your map)
