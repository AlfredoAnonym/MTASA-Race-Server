# MTASA-Race-Server
MTA:SA Race Server scripts, that will be fetched from this respository to my server

The stuff from here, will be fetched to my server: mtasa://51.75.58.35:10899 - and mainly those will be things for my "Map Uploader" resource, where you can upload maps (if you are logged in of course) straight from my server, inputting either a meta.xml + .map contents, or filling up the neccessary info about the map without meta.xml (it will get created automatically for your map)

This repository contains important racing scripts, that map uploader can inject into your map (like lamppost remover - pole remover). Map uploader might be released on GitHub soon too so you can check it out how it works, if everything will work out as intended.
